# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

An automated system designed to detect Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal fundus images using deep learning, aimed at supporting early diagnosis and reducing preventable vision loss.

## About

The Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System is a deep learning–based project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze retinal fundus images and classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Early detection of DR is critical for preventing blindness, but traditional screening methods rely heavily on manual evaluation by ophthalmologists, which is time-consuming and prone to human error.
This system addresses these challenges by providing a fast, scalable, and highly accurate automated screening tool. The model learns to identify important retinal features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates directly from images, improving diagnostic support for healthcare providers.

## Features

- Implements advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

- A framework-based application for deployment and real-time screening.

- High scalability for processing large retinal image datasets.

- Reduced time complexity with efficient training and inference.

- A structured prediction model using standardized imaging datasets.

## Requirements


* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning libraries.

* Development Environment: Python 3.7 or later for building and testing the DR detection model.

* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow or PyTorch for CNN model training and evaluation.

* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV for preprocessing retinal images (cropping, resizing, normalization).

* Version Control: Git for maintaining the project repository and ensuring efficient code collaboration.

* IDE: VSCode or PyCharm for coding, debugging, and environment management.

Additional Dependencies: Includes NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, and Pillow for data handling and deep learning operations.

## Results and Impact

The Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System using CNN successfully identifies retinal abnormalities from fundus images with high accuracy. The model efficiently classifies images into different DR severity levels and detects early signs such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates. The automated system reduces manual effort, minimizes diagnostic errors, and provides fast and reliable predictions, making it suitable for large-scale screening and clinical support.
